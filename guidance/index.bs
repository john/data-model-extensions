# Introduction 

The [=Pathfinder Framework=] gives guidance for footprint information calculation 
shared by a multitude of industries and sectors. The Framework itself and the 
data attributes defined in it (the [=Pathfinder Data Model=]) are – by design – industry-agnostic.

The [=Pathfinder Network=] is the realization of the Pathfinder Framework with aspiration to become
"an open and global network of interoperable solutions for the secure peer-to-peer exchange of 
accurate, primary and verified product emissions data – across all industries and value chains” 
– quotation from [Pathfinder Vision Doc](https://www.carbon-transparency.com/media/luhii1or/pathfinder-network-vision-paper.pdf).

The [PACT Initiative](https://www.carbon-transparency.com/) is the umbrella under which the 
Pathfinder Framework and the Pathfinder Network is evolved. 

Different sector-specific initiatives and members of the PACT Initiative have raised interest 
to extend the Pathfinder Data Model. Additional attributes of higher specificity enhance the utility 
of the Pathfinder Data Model. 

Data Extensions are an opportunity to open up the Pathfinder network for other business 
cases around emission data. Future openness and adaptability of the Pathfinder Data Model 
can be seen as a key enabler to converge onto a single shared emission data exchange format.



# Subject 

The subject of this document (“the Criteria Catalog”) is the intersection between 
the Pathfinder Framework and its derived data model as specified in the 
[=Use Case 001 Specification=].

It defines Data Model Extensions to the Pathfinder Framework data model and their conformance. 
The goal of this Criteria Catalog is to motivate and to enable the use of the Pathfinder Network 
in as many domains as possible while adhering to the values of the PACT Initiative.

## Data Model Extension example

<div class="example">
A logistics-sector initiative decided to use the [=Pathfinder data model=]. 
In order to enable GHG carbon emission accounting and reporting on this matter, 
they define an extension. The extension defines attributes related to the 
forthcoming ISO 14083, covering shipments and consignments.
</div>

## Business value

<div class="note">Non-normative</div>

1. **Increasing the utility of the Pathfinder Network for its members**: by allowing them to enrich the data exchanged such that the data has an even higher value – for instance through better explainability of values
2. **To increase the reach of the Pathfinder Network by pro-actively integrating other initiatives and networks with / into the Pathfinder Network**: and thereby improving the utility of the Pathfinder Network for its members
3. **To increase the likelihood for the Pathfinder Framework to become a ubiquitous approach for PCFs and Scope 3 emission data exchange**: by opening up the data model, we hope to increase the likelihood for others to pick up the Pathfinder Framework. This would mean companies need to support fewer accounting frameworks and technical capabilities to exchange PCF data

## Conformance

See [[#criterion-1]] for the definition.

## Not in scope

<div class="note">Non-normative</div>

Emission data which is not GHG emission data is explicitly excluded from this document 
and its criteria catalog. The PACT community would like to apply the same requirements 
and standards to third-party emissions data as for GHG-related data. The criterias required 
for this are yet to be defined.

Note: Future revisions of the guidance are expected to relax the restriction on GHG emission data.

## Decision Tree 2: Should I consider the addition of a certain attribute to an extension? ## {#decision-tree-2}

The following decision tree explains whether a specific attribute is deemed conforming for 
inclusion with an extension.

# Criteria Catalog # {#criteria-catalog}

## Definitions and possible scopes ## {#catalog-definitions-scopes}

### Criterion 1: Definitions ### {#criterion-1}

: <dfn>Extension</dfn>
:: An extension is a set of well-defined additional data attributes that 
	extend the Pathfinder Framework data model.

	Any entity, individual, sector-specific initiative, trade body, initiatives 
	or other groups of entities can define an extension. 

	The purpose of an extension is to increase the utility of the Pathfinder 
	data model for users wanting to exchange product-level GHG emissions data.

: Conformance
:: An extension that conforms to each of the criterias defined in this document, is called a “conforming extension”.


### Criterion 2: Possible scopes ### {#criterion-2}

The general subject matter of extensions must be in the context of product data. 
The data of an extension can therefore be related to product-specific data, 
product-specific emissions data, manufacturing processes or services.

<div class="example">
Potential scopes

1. Emissions in the context of logistics processes
2. Product-specific information such as
	1. Information about manufacturing processes – e.g. "produced with 100% renewable energy"
	2. Information about factories
	3. Information on specific product qualities, features, etc. – e.g. "this product is vegan"
    4. Categorization of the product

</div>

An extension shall not contain additional environmental attributes beyond greenhouse gas emissions.

Note: a future version of the Criteria Catalog will extend the scope to other, non-GHG emission data as well. 

## Data attributes ## {#catalog-data-attributes}

### Criterion 3: Clear separation of Pathfinder Framework data attributes and extensions ### {#criterion-3}

Data attributes must be uniquely attributable to and distinguishable between

- Attributes defined by the PACT Initiative, and
- Attributes defined by extensions.

In the future, it must be possible to extend a Pathfinder Data Model with 
additional attributes that are currently not yet known. Such evolution must not 
lead to possible ambiguities between Pathfinder-specified data and that of extensions.

### Criterion 4: No overriding ### {#criterion-4}

The attribute or attributes of an extension may not override or even 
partially override information that is already included or covered in 
the Pathfinder Framework in any form or sense.

<div class="example">
An extension has an attribute “GHG Emissions”. The definition of the attribute 
is an exact copy of the Pathfinder framework. Such an extension is then deemed 
non-conforming as it (needlessly) duplicates an attribute from the Pathfinder Data Model.
</div>

<div class="example">
An extension has an attribute “GHG Emissions”, but this time with a definition
that is non-conforming with the Pathfinder Framework. Such an extension is then 
deemed non-conforming as it (needlessly) duplicates an attribute from the 
Pathfinder Data Model and changes its semantics. This is further discouraged as it leads to ambiguity and 
misalignment at a methodological-level.
</div>


## Publishing of an extension ## {#catalog-publishing}

### Criterion 5: Publishing of an Extension ### {#criterion-5}

The authors can publish an extension by making it available to the public for 
free over the Internet. The authors of an extension are responsible for performing 
necessary compliance checks (competition law, confidentiality, intellectual property, 
etc.) before publication.
 
The license of a published extension must grant users, commercial entities, 
software vendors, researchers the right to use the extension in a commercial 
and non-commercial manner for free. 

The license should allow for modifications or creation of derived works.


## Interoperability ## {#catalog-interoperability}

### Criterion 6: Referencing, Completeness, and Self-Description ### {#criterion-6}

Once an extension is used to exchange product-level emission data, the data related 
to the extension 

1. must reference the underlying data schema in a machine-readable format.
2. should contain a reference to the documentation of the extension data

: Completeness
:: The data of an extension must be complete in the following sense: 
	it must be possible to make full use of it without extra or additional effort. 
	Such extra effort includes e.g. the need to access another system, database, 
	website, etc.

<div class="example">
Non-conforming extension: An extension has an attribute `ReferenceId` which links to 
an external system and special purpose data access mechanism  (and the information 
referenced is not otherwise available within the Product Footprint statement shared).
Such linking between systems and data access regimes is discouraged. 
It limits interoperability, and it is unclear, whether, how, and if the 
receiving entity is even able to access the data referenced there.
</div>

### Criterion 7: Digital Representation of an Extension ### {#criterion-7}

A published extension must include relevant information for experts such that
they can make meaningful use of the extension (“semantic interoperability”). 
Additionally, a published publication must include technical information to 
reach interoperability at the technical level (“data interoperability” especially).

### Criterion 8: Extensions per Product Footprint ### {#criterion-8}

A [=ProductFootprint=] can contain 1 or more extensions.



# Outlook

<div class="note">Non-normative</div>

The publication of the criteria catalog is the starting point for a more extensive process.

We expect that there will be further publications in the following areas:

1. **Definition of an online catalog of published extensions**: The PACT Community foresees the establishment of an online catalog of published extensions. The governance structure, guiding principles, and methodological requirements for extensions to be published there, will be scoped after the publication of this document.
2. **Expansion of the criteria catalog's scope beyond GHG emission data**: There is already great interest in expanding the scope of this catalog beyond GHG emission data, such as data on air quality, water use, biodiversity among many others. Further specifications in this context can be seen as a possible future task resulting in an extension of the guideline. When doing so, we envision applying the same principles and methods that we use within the PACT community for the expansion into other impact factors as well.
